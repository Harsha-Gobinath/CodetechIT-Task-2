Project : Predictive modelling with Linear Regression
Objective
The project on predictive modeling with linear regression aimed to analyze and forecast a target variable based on a set of independent variables. Utilizing linear regression techniques, the project involved data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results. By building a predictive model, the project sought to provide insights into the relationships between the variables and to make accurate predictions for future observations. The overall goal was to demonstrate the effectiveness of linear regression in predicting outcomes and to showcase its applicability in real-world scenarios.
